* place scripts in B2G repository
* chmod +x on the scripts.
* run the scripts, clone to clone the folders, update to update the folders.

* NOTE: I know I probably should just make a loop with the languages and also check to see if the folders existed.  The reason why I didn't build these files this way was because it was easier just to do a find and replace in a text file at the time to fill in the parts I needed around the languages based on a list I saw of the repo.  lazy reason and I should fix it... I know...
